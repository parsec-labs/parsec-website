Hello everybody. It’s Ross - a Communications Lead Link. We are starting a series of articles devoted to gaming and esports industries. We’ll be looking into what advantages the blockchain technology might provide us with and cover the solutions from <a href="https://www.parseclabs.org/">PARSEC Labs</a> to these relating industries. The series of articles will be divided into two parts - we’ll start off by talking about esports, which is increasingly gaining traction nowadays and then attend to in every way much more major industry.

<b>I. Tokenizing esports clubs </b>

If you keep up with how esports is developing, you’re well aware of its rapid growth and of how significant are the investments being poured in it. The number of big tournaments is growing year by year, prize pools, salaries as well as players’ and management’s transfer fees are zooming up swiftly. Leading world-famous esports clubs have to be on the continuous lookout for new investment and turn to big venture funds, in return allowing them to take the cut from their companies.

Inactivity will soon or late cause your best players to move to more affluent and successful clubs leaving you behind with the necessity to look for new players or put a stake on raw newcomers. Naturally, the whole esports club is likely to take a hit if leading players and stars leave as it damages the results, capitalization and team recognition. The history of esports has seen a lot of suchlike instances. 

This seems avoidable if the owners are ready to release tokens for their esports clubs. Not only is a well-run token sale, reinforced by reputable and recognizable esports brand, an excellent tool to bring in funds but also it is a way to move into a higher gear of interaction and communication with club fans.

Tokenizing offers exciting possibilities for team owners to grow and further develop their business, and for fans to exchange their tokens into:

- access to different team activities (autograph sessions, going on trips with a team);
- a chance to play with favorite players during streams;
- access to the unique club content (videos, photos, articles, reviews, analytics);
- unique avatars, fonts and rights during stream broadcast;
- possibility to buy unique merchandise for tokens (named T-shirts etc.);
- participation in decision making regarding the players and rosters matters and a chance to participate in running the club (for the biggest token owners);

<b>II. Fair and secured esports with smart contracts</b>

Take part in esports tournaments, win and make big money! Right? Not really and far from always. Unfortunately fraud is still widely present in esports - some organizers <a href="https://compete.kotaku.com/last-years-cs-go-world-champions-still-havent-been-paid-1797059182">do not pay prize money</a>, and teams are forced to wait for their money till doomsday and believe in rosy future.

Team owners themselves do not always display unassailable integrity: some of them practice deceit, paying either much less than it was agreed or not paying at all. However developed esports is nowadays, there are issues regarding contracts and contract commitments - contracts are often poorly drafted and fail to protect player rights in court. Smart-contract technology is the remedy that tackles such matters and is projected to make esports more transparent and fair. Application of smart-contracts enables both sides to make sure all the financial and other commitments are fulfilled. 

Moreover, smart-contracts can be helpful in unification of tournament rules, so that new organizes won’t have to reinvent the wheel and create new rules and formats from scratch. For instance, some afore-approved as optimal tournament format from ESL (the number 1 esports operator worldwide) will be integrated into open source smart-contract that can be picked up by any other tournament operator, if desired. We believe that in future all leading players on esports market will in either way deploy blockchain in their work.

<b>III. Blockchain games for esports?</b>

Does esports offer any room for blockchain games or the games whose mechanics apply blockchain solutions? There aren’t any of them yet, however they are likely to hit the scene in future. It can be both card games and strategies, running on blockchain as well as games of other genres, especially if they have in-game shops and items.

Blockchain can also be used to log all in-game items. For example developers will find it impossible to sneak-release another 1000 rare and expensive skins or weapon types if the pre-announced number didn’t exceed a hundred. It will be an easy to notice fraud for gaming community.  

In this way blockchain can protect the owners of rare and limited skins and secure them from sly actions of game developers. True ownership of virtual assets is very important for gamers also and blockchain can help with it. Also, blockchain application covers the exchange of items between players and is used for arbitrage should something go wrong. Each sending of skin will have its unique TxHash, so that you can track any transaction and find out whether the deal was made or not.

<b>BONUS: Blockchain education for esports fans</b>

Blockchain is certainly a technology of future, and the sooner you get to know it the better. Esports audience involves young people mostly, ranging from 16 to 35 years old. Esports fans follow the trends, feel at home with technology and devices, keeping up to speed with the most relevant and interesting events. Having teamed up with programmers and financial sector reps, gamers and esports fans were the first ones to get acquainted with blockchain and are disposed to its ideas as well as to the idea of decentralization. 

Taking interest in blockchain industry, esports fans discover wide possibilities for self-education and learn topical technology which is set to change the world in the foreseeable future.
