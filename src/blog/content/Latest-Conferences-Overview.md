Hello, community!

We do strongly believe that sharing knowledge about blockchain and it's benefits is one of our main goals because blockchain technology has multiple benefits over the traditional approach in various areas.

PARSEC Labs is focused mainly on building PoS based Plasma chain but some of us think that without finding a way to integrate our chain into some existing business models it can die as a product very soon. That is why we do believe that communication and finding new potential user/partners/developers for our community is the main goal for our Communication circle.

Bunch of team members from our community has attended multiple blockchain related conferences and meetups in the past month. Here is a couple of them:
- <a href="https://www.meetup.com/blockchainstartupslviv/events/253546111/">Introducing Blockchain 3.0</a> 
- <a href="https://dou.ua/calendar/22188/">Lviv blockchain meetup</a>
- <a href="https://dou.ua/calendar/21331/">Lviv .NET TechTalk: Blockchain Edition</a>

We have put together summaries for the main topics of these conferences.

## Main topics overview

#### A Beginner’s Guide to Smart Contracts

The best way to describe smart contracts is to compare the technology to a vending machine. Ordinarily, you would go to a lawyer or a notary, pay them, and wait while you get the document. With smart contracts, you simply drop a bitcoin into the vending machine (i.e. ledger), and your escrow, driver’s license, or whatever drops into your account. More so, smart contracts not only define the rules and penalties around an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does, but also automatically enforce those obligations.

#### How to create smart contracts

This topic was covered on multiple meetups and as a summary, we can say that most contracts are written in a programming language called Solidity, a language similar to JavaScript. Developer may use Ganache tool to create a private blockchain that runs on her machine only. Copy of MyEtherWallet may be used to execute smart contracts.

#### What is a Crypto Token

Tokens are a representation of a particular asset or utility, that usually resides on top of another blockchain. Tokens can represent basically any assets that are fungible and tradeable, from commodities to loyalty points to even other cryptocurrencies!

#### What are the current limitations of blockchain platforms?

Some people in the blockchain industry have pointed out that blockchain has become overhyped, when, in reality, the technology has limitations and is inappropriate for many digital interactions. But through research and development, success and failure, trial and error, we have learned the current issues and limitations of blockchains are Complexity, Network size, Transaction costs, Network speed, Human error, Unavoidable security flaw, Politics.

#### .NET Blockchain platforms

Stratis launched the much anticipated nStratis Development Framework (SDF) – enabling blockchain development in C# and .NET. SDF marks a major milestone accomplished by the Stratis development team that will allow support for the accelerated development of powerful, open source, cross-platform blockchain applications on Microsoft’s .net framework.

#### Azure BaaS

A common blockchain pattern is IoT-enabled monitoring of an asset as it moves along a multi-party supply chain. A great example of this pattern is the refrigerated transportation of perishable goods like food or pharmaceuticals where certain compliance rules must be met throughout the duration of the transportation process. In this scenario, an initiating counterparty (such as a retailer) specifies contractual conditions, such as a required humidity and temperature range, that the custodians on the supply chain must adhere to. At any point, if the device takes a temperature or humidity measurement that is out of range, the smart contract state will be updated to indicate that it's out of compliance, recording a transaction on the blockchain and triggering remediating events downstream.

#### Introducing Blockchain 3.0

The first version of blockchain of bitcoin blockchain focuses on peer-to-peer money transfer. As blockchain technology evolved from this version 1.0, Ethereum has emerged as version 2.0 allowing decentralized apps to be built on top of it. Version 3.0 promises to be highly scalable with millions of transactions running on it with the aim of allowing real-world complex applications to run atop.

#### Write your own blockchain with Tendermint

Write a state-machine in any language (e.g. Golang, Python, etc), and plug it into Tendermint’s consensus engine. Tendermint is responsible for p2p networking, consensus, and transaction broadcasting. After nodes come to consensus on a block, they push it to the state-machine via a unix-socket protocol called ABCI.

## Wrapping up

We hope that you will find these topics interesting for you and this will motivate you to join us in some upcoming events. If you are planning to visit some interesting conference - let us now at our socials, we might join you there.
